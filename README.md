# Frying Pan

A relic that changes all attack cards to be strike cards. This includes generated cards from things like Dead Branch 
and Discovery. Any cards that were already strike cards get one extra damage.

Found in shops.

Synergizes with Strike Dummy and Perfected Strike.

**ARCHIVED:** This relic is incorporated into the [Dumb Attack Pack](https://github.com/EricBartusch/StS-DumbAttackPack)
